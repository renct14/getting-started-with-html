  <em>(a course by <img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.userdata.www.universalsubtitles.org/teams/logo/cd2825021f6c59ca5d4dc5019a43d6896363783e.png" height="40">)</em>

    This course I have enrolled in will teach me about:
    <li>The web</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>URLs</li>
    <li>HTTP</li>
    <li>Web applications</li>
  </p>

  <p>
    At this stage, I have learnt the basic concepts of <i><b>the web</b></i> and <i><b>HTML</b></i>.
  </p>

  <h3>The web</h3>

  <p>
    The web are numerous computers communicating with each other. Through your browser (e.g. Chrome or Firefox) you can send <i>HTTP requests</i> to servers through the internet. That server will then fetch and return the appropriate <i>HTML documents</i>,
    which your web browser will interpret and display back to you. The web mainly contains HTML documents, but can also have many other things including images, videos, PDFs, etc.
  </p>

  <h3>HTML</h3>

  <p>
    HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>. HTML is made up of:
    <li>text content - what you see</li>
    <li>markup - what it looks like</li>
    <li>references to other documents - e.g. images and videos</li>
    <li>links to other pages</li>
    <br> A HTML element is made up of an opening tag followed by the content and a closing tag. A void tag is a type of tag that has no content.
    <br> Another thing to note is that any <u>whitespace</u> in HTML will automatically turn into a <u>single space</u>.
